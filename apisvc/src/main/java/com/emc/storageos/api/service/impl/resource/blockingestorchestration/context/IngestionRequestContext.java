/**
 * IngestionRequestContext is instantiated once per user request
 * for ingestion of UnManagedVolumes in the UnManagedVolume service.
 * It can be used for ingestion of both exported and unexported volumes.
 * 
 * It can also be used by Volume types that have a "backend" concept,
 * such as VPLEX or RecoverPoint volumes, to encapsulate everything
 * dependent that must be ingested for that volume. For example,
 * VplexVolumeIngestionContext, a VolumeIngestionContext, also implements
 * this interface, allowing it to be used as a nested IngestionRequestContext
 * for its backend volumes and exports.
 * 
 * This class implements Iterator<UnManagedVolume> and holds a nested
 * iterator of URIs for these UnManagedVolumes, so the UnManagedVolumeService
 * can iterate this class directly. Each UnManagedVolume is
 * instantiated when next is called, and this ensure the current unmanaged
 * volume is set correctly and the current VolumeIngestionContext is
 * created for the currently iterating volume.
 * 
 * This class includes a VolumeIngestionContextFactory that will
 * creates the correct VolumeIngestionContext object for the current
 * volume based on the UnManagedVolume type.
 * 
 * This class holds all the tracking collections for persistence of
 * ingested unmanaged objects at the end of a successful ingestion run.
